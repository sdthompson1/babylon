This folder contains several example programs in the Babylon language.

The "Demo_" files are a series of examples explaining different
features of the language. If these are read in order then the reader
should get a reasonably good idea of how the language and compiler
work.

The "chess" folder gives a somewhat larger example of an interactive
chess game.
